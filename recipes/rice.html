        <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
        <p>Flavorful and delicious. No one will guess this authentic tasting rice was made from instant rice.</p>

        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook and stir the chopped onion until browned, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the rice, tomatoes, cilantro, and chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the rice is cooked and most of the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.</li>
